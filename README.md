## About The Project

Re-Using my previous code to plot an image in Desmos using Moore's Neighbourhood Boundary Tracing to get the contours, I instead used the OpenCV contour tracing to plot the contours of each frame from a video, using MatPlotLib's FuncAnimation. It works pretty nicely and an example result is attached below for a few seconds of the intro to Bakemonogatari.
